        "# Training Neural Networks\n",
        "\n",
        "Backpropagation [[Cite:rumelhart1986learning]](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~vincentp/ift3395/lectures/backprop_old.pdf) is one of the most common methods for training a neural network. Rumelhart, Hinton, & Williams introduced backpropagation, and it remains popular today. Programmers frequently train deep neural networks with backpropagation because it scales really well when run on graphical processing units (GPUs). To understand this algorithm for neural networks, we must examine how to train it as well as how it processes a pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "Researchers have extended classic backpropagation and modified to give rise to many different training algorithms. This section will discuss the most commonly used training algorithms for neural networks. We begin with classic backpropagation and end the chapter with stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\n",
        "\n",
        "Backpropagation is the primary means of determining a neural network's weights during training. Backpropagation works by calculating a weight change amount ($v_t$) for every weight($\\theta$, theta) in the neural network. This value is subtracted from every weight by the following equation: \n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\theta_t = \\theta_{t-1} - v_t $$\n",
        "\n",
        "We repeat this process for every iteration($t$). The training algorithm determines how we calculate the weight change. Classic backpropagation calculates a gradient ($\\nabla$, nabla) for every weight in the neural network for the neural network's error function ($J$). We scale the gradient by a learning rate ($\\eta$, eta).\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ v_t = \\eta \\nabla_{\\theta_{t-1}} J(\\theta_{t-1}) $$\n",
        "\n",
        "The learning rate is an important concept for backpropagation training. Setting the learning rate can be complex:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Too low a learning rate will usually converge to a reasonable solution; however, the process will be prolonged.\n",
        "* Too high of a learning rate will either fail outright or converge to a higher error than a better learning rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common values for learning rate are: 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Backpropagation is a gradient descent type, and many texts will use these two terms interchangeably. Gradient descent refers to calculating a gradient on each weight in the neural network for each training element. Because the neural network will not output the expected value for a training element, the gradient of each weight will indicate how to modify each weight to achieve the expected output. If the neural network did output exactly what was expected, the gradient for each weight would be 0, indicating that no change to the weight is necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "The gradient is the derivative of the error function at the weight's current value. The error function measures the distance of the neural network's output from the expected output. We can use gradient descent, a process in which each weight's gradient value can reach even lower values of the error function. \n",
        "  \n",
        "The gradient is the partial derivative of each weight in the neural network concerning the error function. Each weight has a gradient that is the slope of the error function. Weight is a connection between two neurons. Calculating the gradient of the error function allows the training method to determine whether it should increase or decrease the weight. In turn, this determination will decrease the error of the neural network. The error is the difference between the expected output and actual output of the neural network. Many different training methods called propagation-training algorithms utilize gradients. In all of them, the sign of the gradient tells the neural network the following information:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Zero gradient - The weight does not contribute to the neural network's error.\n",
        "* Negative gradient - The algorithm should increase the weight to lower error.\n",
        "* Positive gradient - The algorithm should decrease the weight to lower error.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Because many algorithms depend on gradient calculation, we will begin with an analysis of this process. First of all, let's examine the gradient. Essentially, training is a search for the set of weights that will cause the neural network to have the lowest error for a training set. If we had infinite computation resources, we would try every possible combination of weights to determine the one that provided the lowest error during the training. \n",
        "\n",
        "Because we do not have unlimited computing resources, we have to use some shortcuts to prevent the need to examine every possible weight combination. These training methods utilize clever techniques to avoid performing a brute-force search of all weight values. This type of exhaustive search would be impossible because even small networks have an infinite number of weight combinations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider a chart that shows the error of a neural network for each possible weight. Figure 4.DRV is a graph that demonstrates the error for a single weight:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Figure 4.DRV: Derivative**\n",
        "![Derivative](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/master/images/class_2_deriv.png \"Derivative\")\n",
        "\n",
        "Looking at this chart, you can easily see that the optimal weight is where the line has the lowest y-value. The problem is that we see only the error for the current value of the weight; we do not see the entire graph because that process would require an exhaustive search. However, we can determine the slope of the error curve at a particular weight. In the above chart, we see the slope of the error curve at 1.5. The straight line barely touches the error curve at 1.5 gives the slope. In this case, the slope, or gradient, is -0.5622. The negative slope indicates that an increase in the weight will lower the error.\n",
        "The gradient is the instantaneous slope of the error function at the specified weight. The derivative of the error curve at that point gives the gradient. This line tells us the steepness of the error function at the given weight.  \n",
        "Derivatives are one of the most fundamental concepts in calculus. For this book, you need to understand that a derivative provides the slope of a function at a specific point. A training technique and this slope can give you the information to adjust the weight for a lower error. Using our working definition of the gradient, we will show how to calculate it.\n",

        "## Momentum Backpropagation\n",
        "\n",
        "Momentum adds another term to the calculation of $v_t$:\n",

        "$$ v_t = \\eta \\nabla_{\\theta_{t-1}} J(\\theta_{t-1}) + \\lambda v_{t-1} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Like the learning rate, momentum adds another training parameter that scales the effect of momentum. Momentum backpropagation has two training parameters: learning rate ($\\eta$, eta) and momentum ($\\lambda$, lambda). Momentum adds the scaled value of the previous weight change amount ($v_{t-1}$) to the current weight change amount($v_t$).\n",
        "\n",
        "This technique has the effect of adding additional force behind the direction a weight is moving. Figure 4.MTM shows how this might allow the weight to escape local minima.\n",
